# Dumbphone App - Turn Your Smartphone Dumb
An independent project I did for a class. This is a "launcher" app. It replaces the home menu on your android device with a simple menu containing all the necesities. It turns your phone dumb. Feel free to distribute and download yourself. It helps me focus when I need to study.


## How to Download:

1. Download APK file onto your Android device located [here](https://github.com/joehawkens/DumbphoneApp/tree/main/Versions).
2. Run APK file on your Android device.
3. This will install the program and everything should take care of itself 
4. **Note: You need to have Spotify and Google Maps downloaded to your phone before you can use them in the app.**
